# Series finder

This exercise is a TV series search web application. Typing the search text and pressing the "Search" button displays a list of the series that include that text in their name. By clicking on a tab of a series you can add it to favorites. Pressing "delete X" deletes the series of favorites.

The original idea of this project is from [Adalab's](http://adalab.es "Adalab Digital") and is part of its training, more specifically the Final Evaluation Module II, focused on JavaScript.
